# Conclusions
This project was a success in terms of getting a state estimation algorithm running in real time, on real hardware, and in a difficult problem. We dove deep into the world of ROS, Linux, and many many debugging techniques. The performance of the estimator can still be tweaked for performance and accuracy, but we are satisfied given that we got one actually working. 


# Acknowledgements
Thank you to Prof. Shia for showing us the world of state estimation. We are excited to apply this knowledge in all sorts of applications in the future!
